---------- Scoping ---------------

1)	When inside a subtype fix the scoping so elements from the super type can be used without errors. 
2) 	Deal With Constructed types in some meaningful way.
3) 	Check that when a constructed type is passed as a supertype that it is the only supertype (I think), 
	either way more needs to be thought out on this concept.
4)  To get stuff working I allowed unicode characters in expression, unfortunately This means that I have
    to have spaces between special characters like quantifiers and variable names, this is an irritation.
5)  Follow the instructions from the book into how to make the Main lib available from outside of eclipse.
	(This may not be necessary if we think that we're never going to use it outside of eclipse).
