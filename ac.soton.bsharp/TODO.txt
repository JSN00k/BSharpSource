---------- Scoping ---------------

1)	When inside a subtype fix the scoping so elements from the super type can be used without errors. 
2) 	Deal With Constructed types in some meaningful way.
3) 	Check that when a constructed type is passed as a supertype that it is the only supertype (I think), 
	either way more needs to be thought out on this concept.
